# F Layout Design

<ul>
<li>A "Fast Pattern" design.</li>
<li>Reads left to right, and top to bottom.</li>
<li>Important information is positioned at the top horizontal line.</li>
<li>Lesser info is on the left edge, like an aside.</li>
</ul>

### Example

# Z Layout Design

<ul>
<li>Simplicity is priority. Minimalistic approach.</li>
<li>Like F layout, Z also reads left to right, top to bottom.</li>
<li>Top horizontal includes main components.</li>
<li>Diagonal line includes bits of information.</li>
<li>Bottom right would include a CTA; a form, big button, some user interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example<h3>

<h1>Golden Rule of Thirds/Golden Ratio</h1>

<ul>
<li>Diving the window or picture into a grid with 9 equal parts, 3 X 3,
and placing the objects of interest at the points of line intersection gives emphasis
and better visual aesthetics.</li>
<li>More pleasing to the eye and tells viewer's eye where to look/focus</li>
<li>Creates space in view and is more interesting to look at then something right in middle of picture</li>
<li>Golden Ratio is 1:1.618. Discovered by Fibonacci. Agreed upon widely as
aesthetically pleasing to the eye when used.</li>
<li>Golden ratio is seen often in nature. Shells, flowers, and many other objects
in nature have the golden ratio structure.</li>
</ul>
