# F Pattern Design

F Pattern, also known as "Fast Pattern" design, is a design that was the product of
study by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-people-read-web-eyetracking-evidence/), who used eye tracking technology to recognize patterns of how users analyze and consume content.

When applying this pattern think, "scanners"; where do you expect a user will focus first.

In an F Pattern, users read content in screen like a book; left to right and top to bottom. <br>
Users first read in a horizontal movement across the upper part of a page. <br>
Next, users move down and create a second horizontal line that usually cover a smaller area than the previous line. <br>
Additional horizontal lines or eye sweeps move less and less to the right and the eye sticks closer to the left as it moves down.

# Z Pattern Design

Like F Pattern, a Z Pattern is also influenced by eye tracking technology. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Similar to an F Pattern, in a Z Pattern users read a page like a book; left to right and top to bottom. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Important information and the main components you want users to see first are positioned
at the top horizontal line. <br>
The diagonal line should include bits of information that will build up your CTA(call to action). <br>
The bottom horizontal line should highlight your CTA, a form, bit button, some form user interaction.

# Neumorphism

**Neu and Morphic: Neu: New + Morphic: a variant of Morphous, meaning having a specific shape or form. This word was also used in an old interface design trend called Skeumorphic.**

Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a design style that is known for its use of light exposure. Meaning manipulating light on object like images to give a bright to contrasting shadow effect.

What gives Neumorphism such a popular gain of interest is that it draws from skeumorphism and other popular design styles like **Flat UI**.

<h1>Glassmorphism<h1>

<h3>Example<h3>

<h1>Golden Rule of Thirds/Golden Ratio</h1>

<ul>
<li>Diving the window or picture into a grid with 9 equal parts, 3 X 3,
and placing the objects of interest at the points of line intersection gives emphasis
and better visual aesthetics.</li>
<li>More pleasing to the eye and tells viewer's eye where to look/focus</li>
<li>Creates space in view and is more interesting to look at then something right in middle of picture</li>
<li>Golden Ratio is 1:1.618. Discovered by Fibonacci. Agreed upon widely as
aesthetically pleasing to the eye when used.</li>
<li>Golden ratio is seen often in nature. Shells, flowers, and many other objects
in nature have the golden ratio structure.</li>
</ul>
