# F Layout Design

<ul>
<li>A "Fast Pattern" design.</li>
<li>Reads left to right, and top to bottom.</li>
<li>Important information is positioned at the top horizontal line.</li>
<li>Lesser info is on the left edge, like an aside.</li>
</ul>

### Example

# Z Layout Design

<ul>
<li>Simplicity is priority. Minimalistic approach.</li>
<li>Like F layout, Z also reads left to right, top to bottom.</li>
<li>Top horizontal includes main components.</li>
<li>Diagonal line includes bits of information.</li>
<li>Bottom right would include a CTA; a form, big button, some user interaction.</li>
</ul>

# Neumorphism
**Neu and Morphic: Neu: New + Morphic: a variant of Morphous, meaning having a specific shape or form. This word was also used in an old interface design trend called Skeumorphic.**

Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a design style that is known for its use of light exposure. Meaning manipulating light on object like images to give a bright to contrasting shadow effect. 

What gives Neumorphism such a popular gain of interest is that it draws from skeumorphism and other popular design styles like **Flat UI**.

# Golden Rule of Thirds/Golden Ratio
Diving the window or picture into a grid with 9 equal parts, 3 X 3,
and placing the objects of interest at the points of line intersection gives emphasis
and better visual aesthetics. This technique is creates informs viewer's eye where to look/focus,
creates space in view and is more interesting to look at then something right in middle of picture.
When you divide a line into two parts and the longer part (a) divided by the smaller part (b) is equal to the sum of (a) + (b) divided by (a), both equal 1.618.
The Golden ratio is seen often in nature. Shells, flowers, and many other objects
in nature have the golden ratio structure.
