# Neumorphism
**Neu and Morphic: Neu: New + Morphic: a variant of Morphous, meaning having a specific shape or form.Â This word was also used in an old interface design trend called Skeumorphic.**

Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a design style that is known for its use of light exposure. Meaning manipulating light on object like images to give a bright to contrasting shadow effect. 

What gives Neumorphism such a popular gain of interest is that it draws from skeumorphism and other popular design styles like **Flat UI**.
