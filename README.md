# F Pattern Design

F Pattern, also known as "Fast Pattern" design, is a design that was the based on a by
study by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-people-read-web-eyetracking-evidence/), who used eye tracking technology to recognize patterns of how users analyze and consume content.

When applying this pattern think, "scanners"; where do you expect a user will focus first.

In an F Pattern, users read content in screen like a book; left to right and top to bottom. <br>
Users first read in a horizontal movement across the upper part of a page. <br>
Next, users move down and create a second horizontal line that usually cover a smaller area than the previous line. <br>
Additional horizontal lines or eye sweeps move less and less to the right and the eye sticks closer to the left as it moves down.

# Z Pattern Design

Like F Pattern, a Z Pattern is also influenced by eye tracking technology. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Similar to an F Pattern, in a Z Pattern users read a page like a book; left to right and top to bottom. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Important information and the main components you want users to see first are positioned
at the top horizontal line. <br>
The diagonal line should include bits of information that will build up your CTA(call to action). <br>
The bottom horizontal line should highlight your CTA, a form, bit button, some form user interaction.

# Neumorphism

**Neu and Morphic: Neu: New + Morphic: a variant of Morphous, meaning having a specific shape or form. This word was also used in an old interface design trend called Skeumorphic.**

Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a design style that is known for its use of light exposure. Meaning manipulating light on object like images to give a bright to contrasting shadow effect.

What gives Neumorphism such a popular gain of interest is that it draws from skeumorphism and other popular design styles like **Flat UI**.

# Glassmorphism
**Glassmorphism:** A light or dark surface, placed on top of colorful backgrounds. Colorful background are necessary for the effect to properly pop more, as the contrasting low-contrast colors will take away the transparency of the design , losing the effects of Glassmorphism.

The main characteristics of a glassmorphism design are:
- Transparency
- Multi-layered approach with floating objects 
- Vivid colors highlighting blurred transparency
- Subtle ,light borders on translucent objects
- Users can establish depth of the surface

# Golden Rule of Thirds/Golden Ratio
Diving the window or picture into a grid with 9 equal parts, 3 X 3,
and placing the objects of interest at the points of line intersection gives emphasis
and better visual aesthetics. This technique is creates informs viewer's eye where to look/focus,
creates space in view and is more interesting to look at then something right in middle of picture.
When you divide a line into two parts and the longer part (a) divided by the smaller part (b) is equal to the sum of (a) + (b) divided by (a), both equal 1.618.
The Golden ratio is seen often in nature. Shells, flowers, and many other objects
in nature have the golden ratio structure.
