# F Pattern Design

F Pattern, also known as "Fast Pattern" design, is a design that was the based on a by
study by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-people-read-web-eyetracking-evidence/), who used eye tracking technology to recognize patterns of how users analyze and consume content.

When applying this pattern think, "scanners"; where do you expect a user will focus first.

In an F Pattern, users read content in screen like a book; left to right and top to bottom. <br>
Users first read in a horizontal movement across the upper part of a page. <br>
Next, users move down and create a second horizontal line that usually cover a smaller area than the previous line. <br>
Additional horizontal lines or eye sweeps move less and less to the right and the eye sticks closer to the left as it moves down.

**_Example_**

# Z Pattern Design

Like F Pattern, a Z Pattern is also influenced by eye tracking technology. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Similar to an F Pattern, in a Z Pattern users read a page like a book; left to right and top to bottom. However, a Z Pattern prioritizes simplicity and focuses on a minimalistic approach.

Important information and the main components you want users to see first are positioned
at the top horizontal line. <br>
The diagonal line should include bits of information that will build up your CTA(call to action). <br>
The bottom horizontal line should highlight your CTA, a form, bit button, some form user interaction.

# Neumorphism

**Neu and Morphic: Neu: New + Morphic: a variant of Morphous, meaning having a specific shape or form.Â This word was also used in an old interface design trend called Skeumorphic.**

Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a design style that is known for its use of light exposure. Meaning manipulating light on object like images to give a bright to contrasting shadow effect.

What gives Neumorphism such a popular gain of interest is that it draws from skeumorphism and other popular design styles like **Flat UI**.

# Glassmorphism
**Glassmorphism:** A light or dark surface, placed on top of colorful backgrounds. Colorful background are necessary for the effect to properly pop more, as the contrasting low-contrast colors will take away the transparency of the design , losing the effects of Glassmorphism.

The main characteristics of a glassmorphism design are:
- Transparency
- Multi-layered approach with floating objects 
- Vivid colors highlighting blurred transparency
- Subtle ,light borders on translucent objects
- Users can establish depth of the surface

# Golden Rule of Thirds/Golden Ratio
Diving the window or picture into a grid with 9 equal parts, 3 X 3,
and placing the objects of interest at the points of line intersection gives emphasis
and better visual aesthetics. This technique is creates informs viewer's eye where to look/focus,
creates space in view and is more interesting to look at then something right in middle of picture.
When you divide a line into two parts and the longer part (a) divided by the smaller part (b) is equal to the sum of (a) + (b) divided by (a), both equal 1.618.
The Golden ratio is seen often in nature. Shells, flowers, and many other objects
in nature have the golden ratio structure.

# General UI Principles
General UI principles and concepts mainly boil down to making life easy for the user. There are many ways to do accomplish this, here are some of the primary ways to do so:

Use color to reflect the overall theme/brand/personality of the content. Don't exaggerate the branding presence 
by using too much of the primary color like for the background color of the page. This can distract the user
from their actions and make contrast, hierarchy more complicated.

Balance the colors used in a 60% primary, 30% secondary, and 10% tertiary. There are tools to contain these ratios that
help and can also be used for the ratio of sizes of the typography, which can use the same ratio between headers, subheaders, body content, action elements, captions etc.

Having a good visual hierarchy by presenting the content in a way that users can easily comprehend 
the importance of each element. Organizing the components so the brain can distinguish the 
objects based on their size, color, contrast and style.

the proximity of elements on screen and negative or white space can help the user group content more easily and thus
categorize them.

Be as clear and simple in your design as possible to avoid confusing the user.
Consistency in design allows the user to recognize and accomplish tasks faster/easier.
Be friendly/forgiving to the user, anticipate errors they may make and give them the opportunity to confirm or correct their decisions to avoid misunderstandings.
Create a visual hierarchy. This can help the user find what is important, what they are looking for more easily, and direct them visually through their actions/steps.
Have a step-by-step information flow, with the focus on what is currently important to them. Only include information that is relevant to their decisions right now.
